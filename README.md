# wheel-of-prizes

Create an interactive "Wheel of Fortune" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game should have the following features:

1. A circular wheel with multiple colored segments, each representing a different prize or outcome.
2. The text in each segment should be centered and clearly visible.
3. A button to spin the wheel.
4. Sound effects: a spinning sound when the wheel is spinning and a winning sound when the wheel stops.
5. The wheel should animate smoothly when spun and gradually slow down until it stops at a random segment.
6. The design should be visually appealing, with well-chosen colors and a clean layout.

Provide the full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement this game.
